abstract: "Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the
  second leading cause of death, worldwide. Still, a paradigm exists in the
  available therapies: while pharmaceutical drugs are non-invasive but have poor
  precision and low effectiveness in the long term, therapies based on
  implantable electrical stimulators have high precision but are also highly
  invasive, which reduces patient eligibility. For the first time, a minimally
  invasive and precise neuromodulation modality is emerging through low
  intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU). However, the hand-held form-factors of
  existing ultrasound technology, together with its spatial resolution still
  being 10x lower than implantable electrodes, are hampering advances in both
  fundamental neuroscience research and the translation to the clinic. In this
  talk, I will describe my research on stand-alone ultrasonic microchips, by
  exploring the co-design and integration of CMOS circuits and piezoelectric
  materials. With massive miniaturization, focused ultrasound can be delivered
  through more efficient methods (wearable, injectable) while supporting higher
  ultrasound frequencies towards higher spatial resolution. These advances will
  contribute to a new generation of ultrasound technology to bring LIFU
  neuromodulation to the forefront of neuroscience and neurology."

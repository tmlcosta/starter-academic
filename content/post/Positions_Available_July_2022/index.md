Focused ultrasound (FUS) brain stimulation is an emerging minimally invasive brain interface that combines high spatial resolution with high depth of penetration. Even though FUS has been shown great promise for the treatment of a vast range of neurological diseases, existing FUS stimulators are still bulky, power inefficient and with limited volumetric spatial resolution. This limits its applications to acute procedures, where test subjects are immobilized, and FUS helmet-like devices are controlled by robotic arms in a highly complex setup.

In our recent UPSIDE EU grant, we will investigate new methods towards the massive integration and miniaturization of power efficient ultrasonic brain stimulators. If you want to be part of our team and work on this exciting project, please apply to one of our available PhD and Postdoc positions, (see the vacancies section).

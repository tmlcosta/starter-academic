A project done at Columbia University (Lead PI: Ken Shepard, Lead Co-Pi: Elisa Konofagou, Main author: Chen Shi) was recently published at Science Advances. Here, we have developed the smallest wireless implantable device to date, with a volume below 0.1 mm^3. By using a conventional b-mode ultrasound imaging probe for both powering and communication, the device is able to sense and transmit temperature wirelessly in real time.

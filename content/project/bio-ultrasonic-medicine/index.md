The emergence of Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) neuromodulation is opening new possibilities for treatments of diseases related to the nervous system by providing both non-invasiveness and high spatial resolution. To overcome the bulky form-factors of existing  handheld/helmet-like stimulators, we are researching novel microtechnologies by exploring CMOS integrated circuit design and integrated piezoelectric materials to enable precise and minimally invasive neuromodulation of the nervous system.

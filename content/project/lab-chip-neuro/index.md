Leveraging on the clinical potential of LIFU neuromodulation, the influence of focused ultrasound on a plethora of biological processes is still heavily debated, with several mechanisms, often contradictory, being hypothesized. To provide a magnified window of observation of these biological processes, we engineer ultrasound microtechnologies to modulate and record cellular and ion-channel activity at the micro and nanoscale.

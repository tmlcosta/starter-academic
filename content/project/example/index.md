title: INTENSE
summary: >-
  The INTENSE project will develop brain implants to improve the lives of people
  who are blind, deaf or paralyzed, or who have epilepsy. The research combines
  the greatly increased knowledge about our brains with new possibilities within
  neurotechnology. To achieve this, we work together with work specialists from
  different backgrounds divided in work packages.


  Dr. Tiago Costa is the [Work Package A](https://intenseproject.eu/work-packages/interface-technology) Co-leader, where he is researching novel integrated circuits to interface with the visual cortex towards a visual prosthesis for the blind.

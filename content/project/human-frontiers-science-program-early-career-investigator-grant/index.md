summary: "Leveraging on the clinical potential of LIFU neuromodulation, the influence of focused ultrasound on a plethora of biological processes is still heavily debated. To provide a magnified window of observation of these biological processes, we engineer lab-on-a-chip microtechnologies to modulate and record cellular and ion-channel activity at the micro-scale."

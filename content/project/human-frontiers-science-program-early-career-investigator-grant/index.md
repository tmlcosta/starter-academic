summary: A plethora of cellular processes, ranging from energy production in
  single cells to cell-to-cell communication in neuronal networks, are based on
  the interplay of proteins and lipid bilayers. Non-invasive tools for
  neuromodulation based on focused ultrasound were developed to overcome
  fundamental limitations in Optogenetics. Yet, little is known about how
  focused ultrasound waves influence the finely tuned interplay of proteins and
  lipid bilayers. Studies using non-systematic approaches at low temporal
  resolution gave rise to contradictory working-models. Hence we propose a
  highly interdisciplinary, systematic and novel approach to study the effects
  of focused ultrasound on the lipid bilayer and on the gating of ion channel
  proteins. We will use a combination of state-of-the-art electronics and highly
  focused ultrasound for stimulation (T. Costa - Electrical Engineering),
  high-bandwidth electrophysiology (A. Hartel - Electrophysiology) and
  computational electrophysiology simulations (W. Kopec - Computational
  Biophysics). This unique combination will allow us, *for the first time*, to
  study the electrical response of the lipid bilayer and the gating of a single
  ion channel at a temporal resolution matching the frequency of the focused
  ultrasound waves in the MHz-regime.

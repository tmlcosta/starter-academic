title: Interface technology for the visual cortex
date: 2021-05-22T12:14:58.898Z
summary: The field of visual prosthesis has seen a drastic development in recent
  years, due to a combination of intensive research on the neuroscience of the
  visual cortex and the development of miniaturized and minimally invasive
  interface technology. The challenge in the latter is on increasing the power
  efficiency of stimulation electronics to enable channel counts in the tens of
  thousands towards high spatial resolution and high coverage of the visual
  cortex. To this end, we are researching high-efficient electrical stimulation
  electronics by exploring novel architectures, stimulation channels and
  waveforms.

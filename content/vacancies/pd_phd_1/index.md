We are looking for highly motivated candidates for a Postdoc or a Ph.D. position to lead the research in our recent HFSP Research Grant - Early Career (project summary below). The ideal candidate has a background in analog and mixed-signal CMOS integrated circuit design, with strong emphasizes on ultra-low noise architectures and/or on biological interfaces. The candidate will lead the IC design part of the project by designing ultra-low noise and high bandwidth circuits to record ion channel protein gating events. To engage with a team of engineers,  experimental and computational biologists, the candidate should be highly driven and team-oriented, with excellent communication skills and a multi-disciplinary mindset.

Interested candidates should send a motivation letter and their CV to t.m.l.costa@tudelft.nl

Project summary: A plethora of cellular processes, ranging from energy production in single cells to cell-to-cell communication in neuronal networks, are based on the interplay of proteins and lipid bilayers. Non-invasive tools for neuromodulation based on focused ultrasound were developed to overcome fundamental limitations in Optogenetics. Yet, little is known about how focused ultrasound waves influence the finely tuned interplay of proteins and lipid bilayers. Studies using non-systematic approaches at low temporal resolution gave rise to contradictory working-models. Hence we propose a highly interdisciplinary, systematic and novel approach to study the effects of focused ultrasound on the lipid bilayer and on the gating of ion channel proteins. We will use a combination of state-of-the-art electronics and highly focused ultrasound for stimulation (T. Costa - Electrical Engineering), high-bandwidth electrophysiology (A. Hartel - Electrophysiology) and computational electrophysiology simulations (W. Kopec - Computational Biophysics). This unique combination will allow us, for the first time, to study the electrical response of the lipid bilayer and the gating of a single ion channel at a temporal resolution matching the frequency of the focused ultrasound waves in the MHz-regime.

Tiago Costa (S’10-M’15) was born in Torres Vedras, Portugal, in 1985. He received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. in electronic engineering from Instituto Superior Técnico - University of Lisbon, Portugal, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering from the same university, in 2014. His PhD research was developed in the signal processing group at INESC-ID, Lisbon, Portugal. In 2015 he joined the Bioelectronic Systems Laboratory at Columbia University, USA, as a postdoctoral research scientist. As of October 2019, he will start a new position as assistant professor at the Bioelectronics group at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.

His research interests focus on developing highly miniaturized devices for emerging biomedical applications, such as electroceuticals, implantable devices for wireless physiological monitoring and lab-on-chip, by combining analog and mixed-signal CMOS circuit design with microfabricated and monolithically integrated transducers.

Currently, he is pursuing the development of new devices for minimally invasive and highly targeted interfaces to the nervous system for the next generation of electroceuticals.
